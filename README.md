PanGet
======
The software PanGet is a special tool for the download of multiple data sets from PANGAEA. It uses the PANGAEA data set ID which is unique and part of the DOI. In a first step a list of ID's of those data sets to be downloaded must be created. There are two choices to define this individual collection of sets. Based on the ID list, the tool will download the data sets. Failed downloads are written to the file *_failed.txt. The functionality of PanGet is also part of the program Pan2Applic (choose File > Download PANGAEA datasets...) and PanTool2 (choose Basic tools > Download PANGAEA datasets...).
